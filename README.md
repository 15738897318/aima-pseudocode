Pseudocode descriptions of the algorithms from Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach"

Currently, the file [algorithms.pdf](https://github.com/aimacode/pseudocode/blob/master/algorithms.pdf) contains all the algorithms from the third edition of the book. As we write the fourth edition, we will put the updated and new algorithms here.
